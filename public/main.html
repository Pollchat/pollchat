				We aim to have a system that will allow users to log in via an Oauth provider (likely Google/Facebook) and create and participate in votes with other users.
				This will be accomplished by the user of websockets connecting to a Go web server. We will process the new question and then give the user a link to share
				with their friends in order to participate in the voting. Alongside the voting we aim to implement a simple chat window that is linked to the vote in order
				for people to let others know they have completed it etc.
